## 1. Goal
Integrate three core graph algorithms in one system for **Smart City / Smart Campus Scheduling**:

1. **Strongly Connected Components** – Tarjan’s algorithm
2. **Topological Sorting** – Kahn’s algorithm
3. **Shortest and Longest Paths in a DAG** – dynamic-programming pattern

All algorithms are instrumented to record metrics and execution time on multiple datasets.
